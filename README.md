# Welcome to Remix + Express + ShadCN Starter Kit
- The easiest way to get started with Remix, Express, and ShadCN UI.

## Introduction and Inspiration

- I needed a Remix and ShadCN UI setup.
- The steps for [installing ShadCN into Remix](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/remix) were outdated and unclear (e.g failed to work with the latest version of RemixJS), therefore I had to fight hundreds of bugs while trying to figure out how to make the two work together correctly.
- I also wanted to use Express as the server for my Remix app, so as to open up the possibility of using other Express middlewares and plugins.
- After hours of bad configuration, I figured a way out, and so I decided to avail this repo to the community so that anyone interested can benefit from it and have it easier than I did.
- I hope this repo helps you in your Remix + Express + ShadCN journey.
- Feel free to contribute to this repo by making a PR, if you have any improvements or suggestions.

## Getting Started

- There are two ways to get started with this repo:

  1. (Preferred) Use the Remix CLI to create a new Remix app with this template
  2. (Not recommended) Clone the repo and install the dependencies

  ### 1. Use the Remix CLI to create a new Remix app with this template

  - Run the following command to create a new Remix app with this template:

    ```shell
    npx create-remix@latest --template DaggieBlanqx/remixjs-expressjs-shadcn
    ```

  - You will be prompted to enter the name of your project. Enter it then hit the enter key.
  - After the project is created, cd into the project directory and run the following command to start the dev server:
    ```shell
    cd your-project-name
    npm run dev
    ```

  ### 2. Clone the repo and install the dependencies

  - If you choose #2, you can clone the repo and install the dependencies as follows:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/DaggieBlanqx/remixjs-expressjs-shadcn
    ```

  - Then cd into the project directory and install the dependencies

    ```shell
    cd remixjs-expressjs-shadcn
    npm install
    ```

  - Then run the dev server
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

## Adding ShadCN Components

- If you want to install ShadCN components for example a [button](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) component, you can do so by running the following command:

  ```shell
  npx shadcn@latest add button
  ```

- Or maybe let us install ShadCN [table](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/table) component for you:

  ```shell
  npx shadcn@latest add table
  ```

## Deployment in Production

First, build your app for production:

```shellell
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```shellell
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
